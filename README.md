# laravel-deployer
Adding a command called deploy to manage deployment on multiple environments, like php artisan deploy:production

The Goal of this package.
When I'm done and I need to deploy something. I felt it would be nice if there is something which just with one command push something to staging, testing and production environement and run necessary steps.
